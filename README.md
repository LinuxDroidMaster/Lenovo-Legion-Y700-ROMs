* Prerequisites:  
  * [Download ADB from the offical source](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools?hl=es-419)
  * You will need the vbmeta.img file from the stock ROM (I have a link to it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaCjtUDoqXA&t=0s))
  * A GSI ROM, in this example we will use [CDROID](/roms/cdroid.md)

```
adb devices
```

2. Reboot to booloader
```
