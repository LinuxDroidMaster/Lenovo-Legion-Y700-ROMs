# CRDroid ROM

* Download link: https://github.com/naz664/crDroid_gsi/releases
* Select the `crDroid-10.5-arm64_bgN-Unofficial.img.xz` image

# Features of this ROM: 
* Android 14
* It has a lot of customization settings
* Gaming mode (but different from the stock ROM)
* Google Play fully functional

# Recommended Settings
* Enable lock screen rotation: Go to Settings > search "rotation" > select "Rotate lock screen" > enable it
* On 2023 Model, the default screen refresh rate setting works fine, if you want to manually force it in fixed high refresh rate mode, you can: Go to Settings > Phh Treble Settings > Misc features > Force FPS > select `1600x2560@120.00001`

# Issues: 
* Can't use the Criterion Channel correctly, which requires Google Widevine L3 + HDCP v1, So I think Netflix and other DRM-related streaming services probably don't work(though I didn't test them yet).
